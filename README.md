This notebook contains Time Series analysis models from the brand new KATS (Kits to Analyze Time Series) package build by the Facebook Research group on WHO verified covid-19 data for Azerbaijan (with the last updates). With KATS we can build 10 different Time Series analysis models such as Linear, Quadratic, ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters, Prophet, AR-Net, LSTM, Theta, and VAR. In this script, you will see 7 of them and an ensemble model as a bonus. Do not be shy to fork and make contributions.
